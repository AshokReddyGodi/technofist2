<legend>DESIGN OF AUTOMATIC ACCIDENT DETECTION AND MANAGEMENT IN VEHICULAR ENVIRONMENT USING IOT</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - Road accidents and traffic congestion are the major problems in urban areas. Currently there is no technology for accident detection. Also due to the delay in reaching of the ambulance to the accident location and the traffic congestion in between accident location and hospital increases the chances of the death of victim. There is a need of introducing a system to reduce the loss of life due to accidents and the time taken by the ambulance to reach the hospital. To overcome the drawback of existing system we will implement the new system in which there is an automatic detection of accident through sensors provided in the vehicle. A main server unit houses the database of all hospitals in the city. A GPS and GSM module in the concerned vehicle will send the location of the accident to the main server which will rush an ambulance from a nearest hospital to the accident spot. Along with this there would be control of traffic light signals in the path of the ambulance using RF communication. This will minimize the time of ambulance to reach the hospital. A patient monitoring system in the ambulance will send the vital parameters of the patient to the concerned hospital. This system is fully automated, thus it finds the accident spot and helping to reach the hospital in time. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>CONTINUOUS PATIENT MONITORING WITH A RELIABLE NEAR FIELD COMMUNICATION SYSTEM FOR ERROR-FREE TREATMENT</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - Near Field Communication (NFC) is a short range, standard based wireless communication technology that allows two-way interaction between two NFC-enabled devices. This paper explains how the technology can be used to meet the challenges in the healthcare management. This technology is user-friendly and commercially viable and can be easily used by a NFC cards, tags, key chains. Each NFC tag has a unique number which can be used for identification of patients in a hospital. The NFC tag can be used as an electronic health record to store the patient’s medical history, prescriptions and real-time sensor data. The current health monitoring methods to measure the various health parameters are tedious and time consuming. The use of NFC along with wireless sensors intends to help the hospital staff to quickly access and monitor the patient’s health record and health status respectively. The NFC technology provides ways to speed up the processes in hospitals; the doctors equipped with NFC-enabled tablets, computers can view all the information about a patient within seconds, without any issue of data being mixed. NFC provides accuracy and efficiency in healthcare as well as it is economically feasible. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

IOT has enabled us to connect our day to day devices in a network for a sole purpose to exchange data. With the growing number of 2-wheel motor vehicles, frequency of accidents is on the rise. A major portion of the fatalities occur because the person was both not wearing a helmet, or his accident was not reported in time, and he could not be saved because he was riding while drunk. Today a number of countries has made it mandatory to wear helmet while riding.  We propose mechanisms that can detect if one is wearing the helmet, detect accidents, and detect whether the person has over-consumed alcohol. These information is send to the concerned person about the accidents, and detect whether the person has over-consumed alcohol. These information is send to the concerned person about the status of the person who is accessing the vehicle. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend> DESIGN OF AUTOMATIC SPEEDBREAKER ON TIME DEMAND USING EMBEDDED SYSTEMS</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - The concept of this project work is to have an automatic speed breaker on time demand according to the requirements. Means when there is no need of the speed breaker on the road, it disappears from the road and the road becomes flat and when there is a need then the speed breaker comes on the road from ground and it starts its working of slowing speed of the vehicles. In implementation of this concept, we use an iron made hemi-cylindrical speed breaker which is capable of rotating itself using control circuitry of embedded systems. So when needed, it comes on road by rotating itself from flat position and when, not needed, it rotates itself again and gets flat and combines with flat road. In the system, real time clock is used to maintain the required time for having the speed breaker on road. When time gets started, breaker comes on road and remains until the countdown gets zero. In the embedded system’s clock any time and date can be stored on which the speed breaker is required on the road. So this type of speed breaker is useful before any building for which the time is specified for coming in the building and going out from it. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AUTHENTICATION FOR SMART VEHICLE SYSTEM USING IOT</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - In this current world where technology is growing up day by day and scientific researchers are presenting new era of discoveries, the need for security is also increasing in all areas. At present, the vehicle usage is basic necessity for everyone. Simultaneously, protecting the vehicle against theft is also very important. Traditional vehicle security system depends on many sensors and cost is also high. When the vehicle is stolen, no more response or alternative could be available to help the owner of the vehicle to find it back. The main goal of this paper is to protect the vehicle from any unauthorized access, using fast, easy-to-use, clear, reliable and economical Biometric scanner. This vehicle security system intimates the status of the vehicle to the authoritative person (owner) using Wi-Fi or Global System for Mobile (GSM) communication technology. If the person is certified, vehicle access is allowed. Else SMS will be sent to the owner and the engine will be immobilized. The prototype model for the security system is built on the embedded platform using Arduino Microcontroller which controls all the processes and cost is also very stumpy. On higher end theft attempts like cutting battery power supply, protection to the vehicle is provided by Engine Control Unit (ECU) embedded on microcontroller. By using GPS technology, vehicle can be identified very easily. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>AUTOMATIC DETECTION AND NOTIFICATION OF POTHOLES AND HUMPS ON ROADS TO AID DRIVERS</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - Roads in India normally have speed breakers so that the vehicle’s speed can be controlled to avoid accidents. However, these speed breakers are unevenly distributed with uneven and unscientific heights. Potholes, formed due to heavy rains and movement of heavy vehicles, also become a major reason for traumatic accidents and loss of human lives. To address the above mentioned problems, a cost effective solution is needed that collects the information about the severity of potholes and humps and also helps drivers to drive safely. With the proposed system an attempt has been made to endorse drivers to ward off the accidents caused due to potholes and raised humps. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>A LOW COST RECONFIGURABLE SMART WATER QUALITY MONITORING SYSTEM IN IOT ENVIRONMENT</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - Nowadays Internet of Things (IoT) and Remote Sensing (RS) techniques are used in different area of research for monitoring, collecting and analysis data from remote locations. Due to the vast increase in global industrial output, rural to urban drift and the over-utilization of land and sea resources, the quality of water available to people has deteriorated greatly. The high use of fertilizers in farms and also other chemicals in sectors such as mining and construction have contributed immensely to the overall reduction of water quality globally. Water is an essential need for human survival and therefore there must be mechanisms put in place to vigorously test the quality of water that made available for drinking in town and city articulated supplies and as well as the rivers, creeks and shoreline that surround our towns and cities. The availability of good quality water is paramount in preventing outbreaks of water-borne diseases as well as improving the quality of life. The development of a surface water monitoring network is a critical element in the assessment and protection of water quality. We developed a prototype of easy to install technology by which the different surface water (e.g. rivers, lakes) quality indicators can be measured. This paper presents a smart water quality monitoring system. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>DESIGN OF IOT BASED SMART AND ADAPTIVE STREET LIGHTING SYSTEM</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - The system is mainly used for smart and weather adaptive lighting in street lights. The project is implemented with smart embedded system that controls the street light based on detection of sunlight. During the night time the street light gets automatically OFF. The ON/OFF can be accessed anywhere anytime through internet. A camera is placed on top of the street light to track the actions performed on the road where the footages are stored in a server. In addition to this, a panic button is placed on the pole, in-case of any emergency or danger, the person in danger can press this button which raises an alarm at the nearby police station. Whenever the panic button is pressed, the footage at that time recorded by the camera is sent directly to the cloud account. The access of the account is given to the particular police station by which they can view the incident’s spot. Each area’s street lights are connected to the particular area’s police station and each of them has a cloud accessible account. The manual operation using GSM technology is completely eliminated. Thus the system is mainly designed to ensure safety and to prevent energy wastage. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - The aim of this work is to develop an intelligent wireless system for monitoring vehicle speed, identify speeding vehicles and imposing penalty for the speeding offenders. A prototype system has been developed in a laboratory environment to generate random speed data using a mechanical wheel (acts as a vehicle), measure the speed data with a Shimmer wireless sensor and transfer the data wirelessly to a server computer for further analysis. Software interface has been developed using Java based socket-programming to monitor the vehicle speed in a server computer and to send the data associated with a speeding vehicle to a remotely placed client computer. The functionality of the software has been tested by experimenting different traffic scenarios. If the vehicle speed is higher than the set speed limit for the road, the system automatically detects it and generates a report with the time of speeding, vehicle number, vehicle speed, etc. The report is saved in a central database (client computer) in order to take further necessary actions for the speeding offender. The experimental evaluation results show that the system can measure and monitor the vehicle speeds wirelessly and manage the speeding data automatically. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>
