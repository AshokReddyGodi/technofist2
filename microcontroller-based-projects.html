<legend>WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS – DENSITY BASED TRAFFIC CONTROLLER</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - In the present scenario vehicular travel is increasing all over the world, especially in large urban areas. Therefore for simulating and optimizing traffic control to better accommodate this increasing demand is arises. In this paper we studied the optimization of traffic light controller in a City using wireless sensor. We have proposed a traffic light controller and simulator that allow us to study different situation of traffic density in City. Using wireless sensor we can easily senses the density of traffic because the general architecture of wireless sensor network is an infrastructure less communication network. Traffic research has the goal to optimize traffic flow of people and goods. As the number of road users constantly increases, and resources provided by current infrastructures are limited, intelligent control of traffic will become a very important issue in the future. However, some limitations to the usage of intelligent traffic control exist. Avoiding traffic jams for example is thought to be beneficial to both environment and economy, but improved traffic-flow may also lead to an increase in demand. There are several models for traffic simulation. In our research we focus on optimization of traffic light controller in a city using wireless sensor and camera and developed visual monitoring. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>A SELF- ADAPTIVE TRAFFIC LIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM BASED ON SPEED OF VEHICLES</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - Intelligent transportation is a typical case of cyber-physical system (CPS). Due to the rapid increasing of the number of vehicles in city, problems caused by vehicles, like congestion and environment pollution, are becoming more and more serious. Traffic light control system is often used to control the vehicles passing for a solution of the congestion in the city. Present control systems used are normally assigned as to be static, i.e., traffic light signal changes in a static way. The aim of this paper is to propose a dynamical traffic light control system, i.e., change the traffic light signals in real time following the speed of vehicles. This system is an instance of V2I(Vehicle to Infrastructure) communication model, realizing data transmission between vehicles and traffic lights. Vehicles send speed messages to the traffic light when passing an intersection, then the traffic light analyzes the information and adjusts the signal time in real time. Each traffic light in each direction has a control strategy of itself without the orthogonal requirement. Therefore, the traffic light is a kind of cyber-physical system. This traffic light control system can maximize the number of vehicles passing intersection, and as a result, minimize the congestion and pollution. A traffic light control algorithm based on speed of vehicles and its simulation are presented. The safety and liveness of this control system are discussed too. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>AUTOMATED SYSTEM FOR METRO TRAIN</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - The main aim of this paper is to make an automated place announcement system for Train, ticket issuing and Open/close of Rail-gate using voice IC and the radio frequency wireless card for tracking the station data and issue of tickets. The paper consists of microcontroller with the RF receiver and the voice recorder chip with speaker. The whole system is attached to the vehicle (BUS or Train). The encoded RFID tags are placed in the BUS stops or the railway stations. The microcontroller in the TRAIN is programmed in such a way that every station name saved in the voice chip which is having a unique code. So whenever the bus or train reaches the station, the reader in the bus or in the train receives the codes, which are transmitted from the tag and the microcontroller receives this code and checks in the look up table, saved in the chip. Whichever matches, the controller will send the command to the voice chip to play that particular voice. At the same time the train stops for about 10-15 seconds in the station and then before leaving the station, it will again start to announce “PLEASE GET INTO THE TRAIN, THE TRAIN WILL LEAVE IN 6 SEC” and the train starts to move to next station. The voice chip will play the voice and this will be heard in the speaker. This voice is repeated till the train leaves the station. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>DIGIBIN – SMART WAY FOR SORTING WASTE IN COMMERCIAL PLACES</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - Waste Management is the pervasive problem. Nowadays and rising continuously with rise in urbanization. Waste is always the mixture of different types of material. The main goal of this project is to design and develop a sorting system that is portable and also sorts the waste automatically. It’s an eco-friendly automatic system. With the Proliferation of Internet of Things(IOT) Devices as Such as Smart phones and Sensors, this Project describes the effective management of solid waste using embedded system. The solar panel and H-bridge are used by the motor to make the system portable. The moving system stops when a non-living obstacle arrives and takes a turn. Otherwise gets the inputs from the waste dumped by the person which is detected by the sensor. The sensor sends a signal to microcontroller where it decides the type of waste (degradable and non- degradable) and separates it automatically and moves forward. Here the IOT module is used to control and monitor the waste. The system consist of mobile app which receives a message when the dustbin is full (3kg)  makes the system to alert and the information is sent to the authority who own this app(“Mr.Bin”).  It even includes database of wastage collection on the particular day. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>FABRICATINO OF AUTOMATED CAR COVER</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> -  In this work an automatic car cover is proposed which will opens itself with the help of push button. It covers the whole car with a thin, but a strong material that not only protects the car from rain, dust and mud (in parked situation) but, also from minor scratches. An assembly of different diameter, concentric cylinders is used to form a hoisting pole and also, so that it could be contained in small space when not in use. The cover material is attached to the top of the aluminium rods on both sides and to a rolling rod, which has the cover rolled on it. Thus providing care to the car from dust and minor scratches. The model also consists of microcontroller and sensors for sensing the surrounding environment and based on the values the car cover mechanism would be activated. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF SIGN LANGUAGE USING FLEX SENSORS</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - This paper presents an effective communication method for differently-Abled persons. Emotion is an important aspect in the interaction between humans. It is fundamental to human experience and rational decision-making. Generally, normal people can easily interact with one another but Sign language is the only means of communication for those who are dumb and deaf.  This paper describes the design and working of a system which is used to communicate and to detect emotions of dumb and deaf. Hence by this methodology differently-abled people can able to interact with each other and also with the normal people. The dumb people use their standard sign language which is not recognizable by common people. 
For This purpose we are converting the sign language into text which is easily understandable by normal people. Sensors are used to detect the sign language and emotions that are processed by PIC microcontroller where the in-built ADC converts the given analog signals into digital form. Then this digital signal is transmitted to LCD. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM FOR VISUALLY IMPAIRED PEOPLE</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - This paper presents an electronic navigation system for visually impaired and blind people (subject). This system understands obstacles around the subject up to 500 cm in front, left and right direction using a network of ultrasonic sensors. It effectively calculates distance of the detected object from the subject and prepares navigation path accordingly avoiding obstacles. It uses speech feedback to aware the subject about the detected obstacle and its distance. This proposed system uses AT89S52 microcontroller based embedded system to process real time data collected using ultrasonic sensor network. Based on direction and distance of detected obstacle, relevant pre-recorded speech message stored in APR9600 flash memory is invoked. Such speech messages are conveyed to the subject using earphone. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>TECHNIQUES WHICH BRINGS SKYWALK TO PLATFORM</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - It is a project which brings the sky walk to platform in railway station. In India we can find skywalk in most of the railway stations. According to survey (Gallup Organization, Hungary) very less people (age around 50-70 years) are using skywalk in railway platform. More percentage of people cross the platform without using skywalks, Which leads more accidents. To avoid these things escalators and passenger lifts are placed in some of the railway stations. As per economy these concept are not feasible.  In this paper we presented an idea which brings the sky walk to platform to make use sky walks very effectively. This type of skywalks helps aged as well as handicap people. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>
