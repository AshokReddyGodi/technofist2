<legend>TITLE - FABRICATION OF AUTOMATIC CONVEYOR BELT WITH PICK AND PLACE WITH DIGITAL COUNTER.</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - A belt conveyor system consists of an endless belt of resilient material connected between two flat pulleys.. This pick and place is automated using a controller which is motor driven. This pick and place module will move to a particular place, pick’s the components and place it on the conveyor belt. At the end of the belt we will have a IR sensor, once the materials placed on the belt breaks the IR barrel a digital counter will start counting. With reference to the above description we are developing a conveyor belt with automatic pick and place and digital counter.  <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>TITLE - SHEET CUTTING USING GENEVA MECHANISM.</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> -  The system consists of a constantly rotating disk coupled with a slotted disk, which gives rise to the desired discrete motion. A rotation of 2p radians of the former causes 2p/N radians of rotation of the latter, where N is the number of slots available on the slotted disk. Thus, one complete rotation of the slotted wheel requires N complete rotations of the other disk, thereby also increasing he otal time period.  By using geneva mechanism we can be able to cut thin sheet metal . DC geared motors and spur gears are used in the project.  <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>TITLE - SEWAGE CLEANING MACHINE.</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> -  In this project the proposal concept is to replace the manual work in drainage cleaning by automated system. Now a day’s even through automation plays a vital role in all industrial applications in the proper disposal of sewages from industries and commercials are still a challenging task. Drainage pipes are using for the disposal and unfortunately sometimes there may be loss of human life while cleaning the blockages in the drainage pipes. To overcome this problem and to save the human life we implement design “automatic sewage cleaning system”. We designed our project to use this in efficient way  to control the disposal of wastages and with regular filtration of wastages, clearance of gaseous substance are treated separately and monitor the disposal of frequent manner.  <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> -  Wood working is anything that performing any operation on wood in any way for some useful work. This multipurpose wood working machine has ability to perform four operations such has Planing, Edge forming, Cutting, and Drilling on a single machine. All the four tools driven by single motor. The belt drives are used can be engaged and disengaged whenever necessary. In this competitive world people are very passionate for their home interior design. In order to produce interior design models carpenter are using separate machines for conducting particular operations so which leads to more cost, material handling is more. In order to avoid these problems this concept is developed. Hence, using this is all about combining planing, drilling, forming and sawing machines in a single platform to reduce the investment cost and floor area and made work easy.  <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - Today the world is now going to be compact. For suitability to the world, things are also going to be made of compact and smaller in size. Now the battle is also done between machines instead of man to man. To win this war and to thought regarding another parallel motive force to the automobile, we have thought of manufacturing "Chairless Chair" through the mission of the project. The exoskeleton based pneumatics support is basically a “chair” which is clothing like an exoskeleton, allowing users to walk or move at certain speed with the device while they work. This chair helps to rest the leg muscle when you are working for a long time. This new and innovative chair helps to comfort to thighs and back. It keeps back straight and reduces pain in the back as well as thighs. The overall weight of this exoskeleton pneumatic chair is only one kg so it doesn't burden on a wearer.  <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>
