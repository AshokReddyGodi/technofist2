<legend>ONE-TIME PASSWORD FOR BIOMETRIC SYSTEMS: DISPOSABLE FEATURE TEMPLATES</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> Biometric access control systems are becoming more commonplace in society. However, these systems are susceptible to replay attacks. During a replay attack, an attacker can capture packets of data that represents an individual’s biometric. The attacker can then replay the data and gain unauthorized access into the system. Traditional password based systems have the ability to use a one-time password scheme. This allows for a unique password to authenticate an individual and it is then disposed. Any captured password will not be effective. Traditional biometric systems use a single feature extraction method to represent an individual, making captured data harder to change than a password. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>ENHANCED PASSWORD PROCESSING SCHEME BASED ON VISUAL CRYPTOGRAPHY AND OCR</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> Traditional password conversion scheme for user authentication is to transform the passwords into hash values. These hash-based password schemes are comparatively simple and fast because those are based on text and famed cryptography. However, those can be exposed to cyber-attacks utilizing password by cracking tool or hash-cracking online sites. Attackers can thoroughly figure out an original password from hash value when that is relatively simple and plain. As a result, many hacking accidents have been happened predominantly in systems adopting those hash-based schemes. In this work, we suggest enhanced password processing scheme based on image using visual cryptography (VC). Different from the traditional scheme based on hash and text, our scheme transforms a user ID of text type to two images encrypted by VC.<b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>FULLY INCREMENTING VISUAL CRYPTOGRAPHY FROM A SUCCINCT NON-MONOTONIC STRUCTURE </legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> Visual cryptography (VC) is a variant form of secret sharing. In general threshold setting, the k-out-of-n VC allows that, in a set of n participants, any k can recover and reconstruct the secret by stacking their shares. Recently, the notion of multiple-secret VC has been introduced to embed multiple secrets. Region incrementing visual cryptography (RIVC) is referred to as a new type of multi-secret VC. RIVC defines s layers and takes s secrets, and then embeds each secret into each layer. The layers are defined by the number of participants; for example, let two secrets and two layers be S2; S3 and L2;L3 in 2-out-of-3 RIVC, where any two participants in L2 can recover S2 and three in L3 can recover S2; S3. However, there is another multi-secret VC, called fully incrementing visual cryptography (FIVC), which also has the layers, but only one secret Si will reveal in one layer Li.<b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>ILLUSIONPIN: SHOULDER-SURFING RESISTANT AUTHENTICATION USING HYBRID IMAGES </legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b>We address the problem of shoulder-surfing attacks on authentication schemes by proposing IllusionPIN (IPIN), a PIN-based authentication method that operates on touchscreen devices. IPIN uses the technique of hybrid images to blend two keypads with different digit orderings in such a way, that the user who is close to the device is seeing one keypad to enter her PIN, while the attacker who is looking at the device from a bigger distance is seeing only the other keypad. The user’s keypad is shuffled in every authentication attempt since the attacker may memorize the spatial arrangement of the pressed digits.<b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>REVERSIBLE DATA HIDING IN ENCRYPTED IMAGES USING INTERPOLATION-BASED DISTRIBUTED SPACE RESERVATION</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b>Reversible data hiding (RDH) in encrypted images has attained more attention recently in research community. Privacy protection of additional data as well as cover media makes it attractive for applications in medical imaging, cloud storage, forensics etc. In this paper, a new method for reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDH-EI), is proposed. Our method adopts the approach of reserving sufficient space for the additional data before encrypting the cover image. First we identify suitable blocks for hiding data from various parts of the image. Before encrypting the image, one or more LSB-planes of these blocks are backed-up into remaining parts of the image using a high-performing traditional RDH method that works on unencrypted images. After encrypting the image, those LSBplanes are used to hide additional data. Recovery of original cover image and error-free extraction of additional data is guaranteed always.<b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>STAMP: ENABLING PRIVACY-PRESERVING LOCATION PROOFS FOR MOBILE USERS</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b>STAMP ensures the integrity and non-transferability of the location proofs and protects users' privacy. A semi-trusted Certification Authority is used to distribute cryptographic keys as well as guard users against collusion by a light-weight entropy-based trust evaluation approach. Our prototype implementation on the Android platform shows that STAMP is low-cost in terms of computational and storage resources. Extensive simulation experiments show that our entropy-based trust model is able to achieve high ( > 0.9) collusion detection accuracy.<b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>
