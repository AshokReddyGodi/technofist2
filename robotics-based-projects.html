<legend>FABRICATION OF AUTOMATIC WINDOW OR GLASS CLEANING ROBOT.</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - The main target is to design a robot that can clean glass windows efficiently and rapidly even in dangerous and hazardous places. The robot will be controlled using a Microcontroller. The motion will generated by DC Motors. This project consists of a base with two wheels which rides on a whiteboard track. The base design allows the robot to cover the entire x-axis of the whiteboard. To move on the y-axis, the robot uses linear sliders to move an arm up and down. Attached to the end of the arm is a dry-eraser that does the actual erasing. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>FABRICATION OF AUTOMATIC FOOT DUST CLEANING MECHANISM.</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - The foot dust cleaning brush arrangement is placed under the foot rest. The foot rest is mounted on the base frame in such a way that any person stands on it the foot rest will go down for the weight to a small distance. Below the foot rest a limit switch is placed. When a person stand on the foot rest, the foot rest goes down and presses the limit switch and the corresponding signal is sent to the motor and it is switched ON. The motor shaft is coupled with the brush arrangement with help of belt and pulley. When the motor runs the brush arrangement also rotates to clean the dust under the foot with the help of belt drive. When the person on the foot rest gets down the limit switch is released and the signal sent is cut and switch off the motor. With the help of limit switch the motor is turned ON and OFF which helps to save power. Depends upon the motor speed the dust can be removed cleanly. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>FABRICATION OF FLEX SENSOR OPERATED ROBOTIC ARM.</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - The arm moment is reciprocated almost exactly by the robotic arm. Data capture is achieved with the special motion capture sensor called &quot;Shape Tape&quot; that is worn by the human operator. Any human arm or even leg, neck or spine moment can be mapped on to any of the robotics.
 Flex sensor robotic arm deals with controlling a bionic/robotic arm with the help of motion sensing technology by Flex Sensors. The system is basically a master-slave system wherein the master motion sensing glove sits on hosts arm sensing motions of the finger and then using this data to control the servos which control the finger movement of the slave bionic/robotic arm. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>FABRICATION OF RESCUE DEVICE FOR LIFTING INFANTS STUCK IN PITS.</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - The proposed system is to save life from the bore wells. Small children without noticing the hole dug for the bore well slip in and get trapped. Since the holes are dug too deep it is quite impossible to save life. The fire force and medical team find it difficult to rescue children due to unknown levels of humidity, temperature and oxygen in the depths of the bore well. Pulling of child is made possible by special graspers, which can grasp the shoulder or the wrist or the ankle of the child. These have been specially designed and fabricated to provide open and close control at one end and facility to extend it by adding additional pipes. A safety rope is provided which acts as a support for the grasper. It is possible to lower the grasper up to 40 feet inside the bore well and the depth of reach can be increased by adding pipes. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>FABRICATION OF DEVELOPMENT OF DATA ACQUITION ROBOT FOR TOXIC ENVIRONMENTAL MONOTORING USING WSN KROTO FINDER.</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - This project is mainly implemented for industrial applications. Mainly for detecting the damages inside the oil pipe that cannot be detected by human beings. Kroto is the Greek word meaning to crack. Inside the pipe, there is very heavy temperature, pressure and toxic gases. So we are implementing a robot that have a camera, temperature sensor, pressure sensor etc which is used to detect the crack and conditions inside the pipe. This data from all the high precision sensors will be transmitted using ZIGBEE protocol from the robot to the control station. The robot incorporates a wireless camera and the data from the cam is transmitted to the frontend Visual studio. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>FABRICATION OF WASTE SEPERATION USING SMART DUSTBIN .</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - The purpose of this project is the realization of a compact, low cost and user friendly segregation system for urban households to streamline the waste management process. We are implementing a smart dustbin which is a cheap, easy to use solution for a segregation system at households, so that it can be sent directly for processing. Larger items are removed by manual sorting. Materials smaller than the diameter of the holes will be able to drop through, but larger particles will remain in the drum. For metallic objects electromagnets or eddy current based separators can be used. Near infrared scanners are used to differentiate between various types of plastics based on the ability of the material to reflect light. X-rays can also be used to segregate materials based on their density.\ The IR sensor detects the waste and activates microcontroller .Generally IR sensor is used to sense certain characteristics of its surroundings by either emitting and/or detecting infrared radiations. Then microcontroller activates DC motor which is used for rotation of the conveyor belt. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>BIOMETRIC BASED RATION VENDING MACHINE.</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - The government of India in an effort to ensure less price supply of ration items to all citizens of India. Supply of ration items like rice, wheat, sugar, kerosene, etc., are provided to the ration holders in limited quantity which is fixed by the government of India. For collecting the ration items person have to stand in long queue in ration shop. Ration shop also take delay in processing to provide ration items. In this paper we present initial design and result of a ration vending machine using fingerprint recognition. This system overcome the problem of standing in queue and having delay. It also effects on corruption which are been take place in ration shop on the bases of fake Id. So it will also provide security to ration holder. Data server and internet can help in modernizing the PDS/ FPS.
Keyword : - Biometrics, fingerprint sensor, recognition, vending ration ,Database.
