            <h4>NETWORKING</h4>
            <p>Technofist provides latest IEEE 2017-18 final year projects for computer science and information science engineering students in networking,Technofist is one of the best final year project institute for CSE,IT engineering students for implementing networking based project.Computer networks support an enormous number of applications and services such as access to the World Wide Web, digital video, digital audio, shared use of application and storage servers, printers, and fax machines, and use of email and instant messaging applications as well as many others. Computer networks differ in the transmission medium used to carry their signals, communications protocols to organize network traffic, the network's size, topology and organizational intent. The best-known computer network is the Internet. </p>
			<p> This website promotes networking projects, network security projects, network design projects, network programming projects, ethical hacking projects and projects in computer network, security protocol analysis and testing along with reports. The site also contains different topics in networking and network security topics which can be used for papers, projects and presentations. The networking projects which are listed on the website are professional projects in networking.</p>

<legend>VEHICULAR CLOUD DATA COLLECTION FOR INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> The Internet of Things (IoT) envisions to connect billions of sensors to the Internet, in order to provide new applications and services for smart cities. IoT will allow the evolution of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) from existing Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs), in which the delivery of various services will be offered to drivers by integrating vehicles, sensors, and mobile devices into a global network. To serve VANET with computational resources, Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC) is recently envisioned with the objective of providing traffic solutions to improve our daily driving. These solutions involve applications and services for the benefit of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), which represent an important part of IoV.<b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>COST MINIMIZATION ALGORITHMS FOR DATA CENTER MANAGEMENT</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> Textual passwords remain the most commonly employed user authentication mechanism, and potentially will continue to be so for years to come. Despite the well-known security and usability issues concerning textual passwords, none of the numerous proposed authentication alternatives appear to have achieved a sufficient level of adoption to dominate in the foreseeable future. Password hints, consisting of a user generated text saved at the account setup stage, are employed in several authentication systems to help users to recall forgotten passwords. However, users are often unable to create hints that jog the memory without revealing too much information regarding the passwords themselves. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>MULTI-PARTY SECRET KEY AGREEMENT OVER STATE-DEPENDENT WIRELESS BROADCAST CHANNELS </legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> We consider a group of m trusted and authenticated nodes that aim to create a shared secret key K over a wireless channel in the presence of an eavesdropper Eve. We assume that there exists a state-dependent wireless broadcast channel from one of the honest nodes to the rest of them including Eve. All of the trusted nodes can also discuss over a cost-free, noiseless and unlimited rate public channel which is also overheard by Eve. For this setup, we develop an information-theoretically secure secret key agreement protocol. We show the optimality of this protocol for “linear deterministic” wireless broadcast channels.<b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>STAMP: ENABLING PRIVACY-PRESERVING LOCATION PROOFS FOR MOBILE USERS</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b>STAMP ensures the integrity and non-transferability of the location proofs and protects users' privacy. A semi-trusted Certification Authority is used to distribute cryptographic keys as well as guard users against collusion by a light-weight entropy-based trust evaluation approach. Our prototype implementation on the Android platform shows that STAMP is low-cost in terms of computational and storage resources. Extensive simulation experiments show that our entropy-based trust model is able to achieve high ( > 0.9) collusion detection accuracy.<b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> Communication technology has completely occupied all the areas of applications. Last decade has however witnessed a drastic evolution in information and communication technology due to the introduction of social media network. Business growth is further achieved via these social media. Nevertheless, increase in the usage of online social networks (OSN) such as Face book, twitter, Instagram etc has however led to the increase in privacy and security concerns.<b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>SOFTWARE DEFINED NETWORKING WITH PSEUDONYM SYSTEMS FOR SECURE VEHICULAR CLOUDS </legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> The vehicular cloud is a promising new paradigm, where vehicular networking and mobile cloud computing are elaborately integrated to enhance the quality of vehicular information services. Pseudonym is a resource for vehicles to protect their location privacy, which should be efficiently utilized to secure vehicular clouds. However, only a few existing architectures of pseudonym systems take flexibility and efficiency into consideration, thus leading to potential threats to location privacy. In this paper, we exploit software-defined networking technology to significantly extend the flexibility and programmability for pseudonym management in vehicular clouds. We propose a software-defined pseudonym system, where the distributed pseudonym pools are promptly scheduled and elastically managed in a hierarchical manner.<b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>AN ENHANCED AVAILABLE BANDWIDTH ESTIMATION TECHNIQUE FOR AN END-TO-END NETWORK PATH</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> This paper presents a unique probing scheme, a rate adjustment algorithm, and a modified excursion detection algorithm (EDA) for estimating the available bandwidth (ABW) of an end-to-end network path more accurately and less intrusively. The proposed algorithm is based on the well-known concept of self-induced congestion and it features a unique probing train structure in which there is a region where packets are sampled more frequently than in other regions. This high-density region enables our algorithm to find the turning point more accurately. When the dynamic ABW is outside of this region, we readjust the lower rate and upper rate of the packet stream to fit the dynamic ABW into that region. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>
