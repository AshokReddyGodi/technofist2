<legend>HUMP POWER GENERATION.</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - This project attempts to show how energy can be tapped and used at a commonly used system, the generation of electricity through the speed breaker mechanism. Generation of electricity through the speed breaker mechanism is one of the most recent power generation concepts.  This  device  converts  the  kinetic  energy  of  the  vehicles  into  electric  energy  by installing movable speed breaker on the road, it takes the stroke motion of the vehicles and converts it to the rotary motion by rack and pinion mechanism and it generates the electricity.
 This project also explains clearly, the working principle of the designed system, its practical implementation, and its advantages. The components have been fabricated and assembled. Practical testing of the system has been done with different loads at different speeds. The utilization of energy is an indication of the growth of a nation. One might conclude that to be materially rich and prosperous, a human being needs to consume more and more energy. And this project is best source of energy that we get in day to day life

<legend>EFFICIENT HYBRID POWER GENERATOR AND MULTI PURPOSE UTILIZATION (WITH SOLAR TRACKING SYSTEM AND PANEL CLEANING MECHANISM).</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - This project consists of solar power and Wind mill generator .Solar tracking system is attached to the model, using which the panel&apos;s will be tilted according to the sun movement to utilize efficient energy. The wind mill generates voltage during day and night time when wind is available .This is a prototype and we can produce 12v always and charge the 12v, 2.7.AHC battery through we can use for  lighting  purpose .Three hours is required to charge the battery (full charge). Consequently, in this project an attempt is made to make the electric and mechanical systems share their powers in an efficient way.
And a panel cleaning mechanism will be installed, which automatically cleans the panels everyday when the solar panel reached the middle position. That is, a DC motor with duster arrangement will swipe the solar panels once the light detecting resistor generates the signal in the afternoon. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>REGENERATIVE BRAKING SYSTEM.</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - Vehicles driven by electric motors use the motor as a generator when using regenerative braking: it is operated as a generator during braking and its output is supplied to an electrical load; the transfer of energy to the load provides the braking effect. Regenerative braking is used on hybrid gas/electric automobiles to recoup some of the energy lost during stopping. This energy is saved in a storage battery and used later to power the motor whenever the car is in electric mode. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>SOLAR TRACKING SYSTEM WITH PANEL CLEANING MECHANISM.</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - In this project we are acquiring the data from the light intensity senses.  Which are then fed to the  comparators, and then they are fed to the Microcontroller.  The software is developed in the Microcontroller such that  It collects the data from the comparators and then drives the DC motor either in the clock wise or in the anti clock wise direction. Here, depending on the light that falls on both the sensors, there will be a slight potential difference and this causes the Microcontroller  to drive the DC motor till both the sensors gets the same light intensity and at this point of time the motor stops and thus indicates the correct location required by the software. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - Wind turbines are machines that generate electricity from the kinetic energy of the wind. In history,  they were more frequently used as a mechanical device that turned machinery. Today, turbines can be used to generate large amounts of electrical energy in wind farms both onshore and offshore.. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>POWER GENERATION USING BICYCLE.</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - All we know about bicycle generator, where a small dc generator is attached to one of the wheel (generally back wheel) of the bicycle. When the bicycle is running, the rotor of the generator which is attached to the wheel of the cycle, also rotates and due to this an emf is generated across the output terminals of the generator. This emf is then generally used for lighting the head-light of the bicycle The bicycle generator is relatively small and a small torque is required to make rotation of its rotor. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH SPEED BREAKER MECHANISM.</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - The project is concerned with generation of electricity from speed breakers-like set up. The load acted upon the speed breaker -setup is there by transmitted to rack and pinion arrangements. Here the reciprocating motion of the speed-breaker is converted into rotary motion using the rack and pinion arrangement. The axis of the pinion is coupled with the Stepper Motor. The stepper motor works as a dynamo. When the stepper motor coupled to pinion rotates in clockwise or antilock wise direction, the kinetic energy is converted into electrical energy. The generator produces the DC current. This DC current now sent to the storage battery where it is stored during the day time. This current is then utilized in the night time for lighting purposes on the either sides of the road to a considerable distance. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - This project consists of solar power and Wind mill generator. Solar tracking system is attached to the model, using which the panel&apos;s will be tilted according to the sun movement to utilize efficient energy. The wind mill generates voltage during day and night time when wind is available .This is a prototype and we can produce 12v always and charge the 12v, 2.7.AHC battery through we can use for  lighting  purpose .Three hours is required to charge the battery (full charge). And a panel cleaning mechanism will be installed, which automatically cleans the panels everyday when the solar panel reached the middle position. That is, a DC motor with dfuster arrangement will swipe the solar panels once the light detecting resistor generates the signal in the afternoon. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>
