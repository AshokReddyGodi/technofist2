<legend>GESTURE RECOGNITION SYSTEM USING MEMS ACCELEROMETERS AND ZIGBEE
TECHNOLOGY.</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> -- The primary objective of the paper is to construct and test a low-cost,
minimally supervised gesture recognition system which identifies static gestures
efficiently and accurately. The proposed system uses ADXL335 accelerometer sensors
which track the gestures and these sensors are interfaced with an Arduino microcontroller
board for data processing and gesture recognition. The software of the system
implemented in the micro-controller, features a computationally feasible algorithm which
requires only nominal resources to recognize the gestures. The paper further elucidates
on minimizing the number of accelerometers to reduce the cost and power-consumption
of the system. The performance of the system is assessed using static gestures in the
alphabets of the American Sign Language (ASL) across data-sets obtained from 3 trained
ASL signers. The average run-time efficiency of the proposed system with a maximum and
minimum configuration of 5 and 2 accelerometers was found to be 95.3% and 87.0%, with
the cost of these prototype systems being realized respectively. It was also found that the
system can be trained for the static gestures of the alphabets in ASL under two minutes by
a new-user with any system configuration. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>DEVELOPMENT OF HAPTIC ROBOTIC ARM.</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> -- The integration of medical science and engineering has made the task like
complicated surgery by robotic arm simpler. To capture the motion of human limbs,
sensors can be used. These units can be worn for video game character modeling, virtual
reality, and activity recognition. The arm moment is reciprocated almost exactly by the
robotic arm. Data capture is achieved with the special motion capture sensor called
“Shape Tape” that is worn by the human operator. Any human arm or even leg, neck or
spine moment can be mapped on to any of the robotic arm manipulator.
Flex sensor robotic arm deals with controlling a bionic/robotic arm with the help of
motion sensing technology by Flex Sensors. The system is basically a master-slave system
wherein the master motion sensing glove sits on hosts arm sensing motions of the finger
and then using this data to control the servos which control the finger movement of the
slave bionic/robotic arm. And a 3-axis sensor or tilt sensor is used for the movement of
the arm to move upwards and down. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>GPS BASED SOLDIER TRACKING AND HEALTH INDICATION SYSTEM.</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> -- In today’s world, enemy warfare is an important factor in any nation’s
security. One of the important and vital roles is played by the army soldiers. There are
many concerns regarding the safety of soldiers. So for their security purpose, many
instruments are mounted on them to view their health status as well as ammunitions
present with them .Bio-sensor systems comprise various types of small physiological
sensors, transmission modules and processing capabilities, and can thus facilitate low-cost
wearable unobtrusive solutions for health monitoring. GPS used to log the longitude and
latitude so that direction can be known easily. These devices are being added to weapons
and firearms, and some militaries such as the Israeli Army which are exploring the
possibility of embedding GPS devices into soldiers vests and uniforms so that field
commanders can track their soldier’s movements in real time. RF module can be used for
High-speed, short-range, soldier-to-soldier wireless communications that will be required
to relay information on situational awareness, tactical instructions, and covert
surveillance related data during special operations reconnaissance and other missions .So
by using these equipments we are trying to implement the basic life- guarding system for
soldier in low cost and high reliability.<b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>LIVE HUMAN DETECTING ROBOT FOR EARTHQUAKE RESCUE OPERATION.</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> -- Natural calamities do occur and they are unstoppable. But humans are
becoming increasingly aware in the concept of intelligent rescue operations in such
calamities so that precious life and material can be saved though calamities cannot be
stopped. Still there are lots of disasters that occur all of a sudden and Earthquake is one
such thing. Earthquakes produce a devastating effect and they see no difference between
human and material. Hence a lot of times humans are buried among the debris and it
become impossible to detect them. A timely rescue can only save the people who are
buried and wounded. Detection by rescue workers becomes time consuming and due to
the vast area that gets affected it becomes more difficult. So the project proposes an
autonomous robotic vehicle that moves in the earthquake prone area and helps in
identifying the alive people and rescue operations.<b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> -- There has been an increase in the road trafficas well as the rail traffic,
accidents at level crossing has increased and this has caused the concern for the Indian
railways. The objective of this project is to provide automatic railway gate at a level
crossing replacing the gates operated by the gatekeepers. In this project we are proposing
a simple solution for the level crossing in which we fix the Radio Frequency tag (RF tag) on
the train. The system reduces the time for which the gate remains closed. This type of
gates can be employed in an unmanned level crossing where the chances of accidents are
higher and reliable operation is required. The collision of trains running on same track is
also prevented by employing IR Transmitter-Receiver system at each sections of the
Station and passes the information to a master control room.<b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>RFID BASED ATTENDANCE SYSTEM WITH SMS NOTIFICATION.</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> -- Now a days due to easy availability of all the information on the internet,
students are less motivated to attend the classes, due to which most of the students are
unable to maintain minimum attendance. This work is to simplify attendance recording
system by using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. RFID based Attendance
recorder with SMS alert System is a web based application that will be developed to
overcome the above stated problem. The system will be developed by using GSM (Global
System for Mobile communication) technology and database support. The information
from RFID Database handling System will be used for taking attendance and for sending
SMS alert also. This System interacts with parents by sending message. Therefore, the
system functionality is not only records the student attendance, but also sends alert SMS
to their parents when the student is absent.<b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>BUS SAFETY SYSTEM FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN USING RFID AND GSM.</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> -- Millions of children need to commute between homes to school every day.
Safer transportation of school children has been a critical issue as it is often observed
that, kids find themselves locked in the school bus at the bus stop after going to school, 
they miss the bus, or ride the wrong bus with no way to track them. This project intends
to find yet another solution to solve this problem by developing a bus safety system that
will control the entry and exit of students from the buses through an energy efficient
methodology. The proposed system will control the entry and exit of students to and from
the bus using RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and GSM technologies to ensure the
entering and exiting of all students to and from the school bus in a safer manner. The
process does not require any additional action by the student and drivers. The system will
do all the process and allow the student to be tracked while entering and leaving the bus.
If the bus journey is successful from the source to destination, it will send an SMS to the
management/parents to inform its departure and arrival.<b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>
