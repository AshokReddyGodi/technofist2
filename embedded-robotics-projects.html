<legend>LIVE HUMAN DETECTING ROBOT FOR EARTHQUAKE RESCUE OPERATION</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - Natural calamities do occur and they are unstoppable. But humans are becoming increasingly aware in the concept of intelligent rescue operations in such calamities so that precious life and material can be saved though calamities cannot be stopped. Still there are lots of disasters that occur all of a sudden and Earthquake is one such thing. Earthquakes produce a devastating effect and they see no difference between human and material. Hence a lot of times humans are buried among the debris and it become impossible to detect them. A timely rescue can only save the people who are buried and wounded. Detection by rescue workers becomes time consuming and due to the vast area that gets affected it becomes more difficult. So the project proposes an autonomous robotic vehicle that moves in the earthquake prone area and helps in identifying the alive people and rescue operations. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend> FABRICATION OF WASTE SAPERATION USING SMART DUSTBIN</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - In recent times, garbage disposal has become a huge cause for concern in the world. A voluminous amount of waste that is generated is disposed by means which have an adverse effect on the environment. The common method of disposal of the waste is by unplanned and uncontrolled open dumping at the landfill sites. This method is injurious to human health, plant and animal life .This harmful method of waste disposal can generate liquid leachate which contaminate surface and ground waters can harbor disease vectors which spread harmful diseases and can degrade aesthetic value of the natural environment and it is an unavailing use of land resources. In India, rag pickers play an important role in the recycling of urban solid waste. Rag pickers and conservancy staff have higher morbidity due to infections of skin, respiratory, gastrointestinal tract and multisystem allergic disorders, in addition to a high prevalence of bites of rodents, dogs and other vermin. Dependency on the rag-pickers can be diminished if segregation takes place at the source of municipal waste generation. The economic value of the waste generated is not realized unless it is recycled completely. Several advancements in technology has also allowed the refuse to be processed into useful entities such as Waste to Energy, where the waste can be used to generate synthetic gas (syngas) made up of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. When the waste is segregated into basic streams such as wet, dry and metallic, the waste has a higher potential of recovery, and consequently, recycled and reused. The wet waste fraction is often converted either into compost or methane-gas or both. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>CHILD RESCUE SYSTEM AGAINST OPEN BORE-WELLS AT AGRICULTURAL FIELDS IN INDIA</legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - This paper presents a proactive approach to prevent child fatalities at the umpteen open uncapped bore-wells in India, which is based on communications using Infra-Red signals. When the IR signal, placed two inches diametrically under the ground surface of bore-well, breaks due to any obstructing object, a buzzer starts sounding as an alert and at the same time, a stake that is kept a few feet lower in the bore-well closes the bore in order to prevent the object from falling deeper into the well. The solution presented in this paper is a simple and yet easily scalable and highly cost-effective solution utilizing the proven technology of Infra-red Signaling. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<legend>Fire Fighting Robot </legend>
<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - Now a days, fire accidents are very common and sometimes it becomes very difficult for a fireman to save someone’s life. It is not possible to appoint a person to continuously observe for accidental fire where robot can do that. Therefore in such cases firefighting robot comes in picture. Robot will detect fire remotely. These robots are mostly useful in industries where probability of accidental fire is more. The proposed vehicle is able to detect presence of fire and extinguishing it automatically by using gas sensor and temperature sensor. It contains gear motors and motor driver to control the movement of robot. Relay circuit is used to control the pump and when it will detect fire then it will communicate with microcontroller (Arduino UNO R3) through Bluetooth module. The proposed robot has a water jet spray which is capable of sprinkling water. The sprinkler can be move towards the required direction .At the time of moving towards the source of fire it may happen that it will come across some obstacles, then it has obstacle avoiding capability. It will provide GUI for arduino operation using android. It detects obstacles using ultrasonic sensors up to range of 80 m. Communication between the mobile phone and robot will take place through Bluetooth, which will have GUI to control the movement of robot. When mobile gets connected to Bluetooth firstly it will set module name, baud rate. It is feasible to implement Bluetooth communication between smartphones and microcontroller. Android controlled robot can be used easily in everyday life such as in homes, market , companies etc. The development of apps for Android in Android SDK is easy and free of cost. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>

<p class="text-block"><b>ABSTRACT</b> - Exoskeleton Arm, a battery powered upper-body robotic arm which instantly increases human strength. Augmenting arm strength by forty pounds, Exoskeleton Arm helps rehabilitate people with back injuries, allowing them to rebuild muscle and relearn motor control. The exoskeleton technology also aids those lifting objects as part of their daily work, particularly in construction or delivery-driven positions. Labor, manual transporting is the main cause of injuries in the Bangladesh work force, and four out of five of these injuries will affect the lower back. Combined, upper body injuries cost the Bangladesh approximately $5 billion annually. Exoskeleton Arm is obviously an ingenious design, but the team’s use of modern, rapid – and relatively inexpensive – manufacturing techniques makes the project even more compelling. We wanted Exoskeleton Arm to be affordable, as exoskeletons are rarely covered by health insurance. This informed our design decisions and the materials we used. Most structural components are machined from inexpensive aluminum. <b style="float:right;font-size:20px;">Contact:<br><i class="fa fa-whatsapp">&nbsp;+91-9008001602</i><br><i class="fa fa-phone">&nbsp;080-40969981</i></b></p>
